# CDRDAO-PLED

_A portable x86_64 Linux release of the latest CDRDAO, by Alex Free_

CDRDAO is a portable open source CD ripping and burning program. CDRDAO-PLED is a [portable](https://alex-free.github.io/pled) Linux x86_64 pre-built download that works on all modern Linux distros. CDRDAO is built from the latest (as of 2/1/2023) '[dev](https://github.com/cdrdao/cdrdao/tree/dev)' branch of CDRDAO, which now [includes](https://github.com/cdrdao/cdrdao/blob/0afa49e7c295fcbca2cb1e65d6c590c39927c6e8/ChangeLog#L13) a [bug fix](https://github.com/cdrdao/cdrdao/pull/14) that allows properly burning PSX BIN+CUE images which contain **both CD audio and [EDC](https://alex-free.github.io/tonyhax-international/anti-piracy-bypass.html#games-with-edc-protection) based additional anti-piracy protection**. More info on how to use this to burn PSX games can be found in my [Ultimate Guide To PSX CD-Rs](https://alex-free.github.io/psx-cdr/burning-with-cdrdao).
